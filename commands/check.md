description: Run the contribution contract over what changed, heal what is mechanically fixable, and return one verdict.
argument-hint: "[files...] (defaults to the working tree diff)"
---

Run the contract over the changed routes and return a verdict. This is the gate that runs on
every contribution, so it is scoped to the diff and nothing else.

**Paths.** `$PALATE` is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`; if that variable is unset you are in a skill
checkout, so use the checkout root. `$SITE` is the project directory (the first argument if it
is a directory, else the current directory).

## 1. Work out what changed

Use `$ARGUMENTS` if it names files. Otherwise take the working tree:

```bash
git -C "$SITE" diff --name-only HEAD
git -C "$SITE" ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Paths must be repo-relative (`src/content/posts/x.md`), not absolute. If nothing changed, say
"nothing to check" and stop. Do not invent a diff.

This is the same pair `/palate-website-builder:preview` and `:publish` use, deliberately, so all
three see an identical change set. Do not substitute `git status --porcelain | awk '{print $NF}'`:
`$NF` takes only the last whitespace-delimited token, so it truncates any path containing a space,
and on a rename line (`R old -> new`) it yields only the destination, dropping the deleted source
that `publish` needs in order to write a redirect.

## 2. Get the plan before running anything

```bash
node "$PALATE/scripts/palate-contract.mjs" "$SITE" --changed <files...> --json
```

Exit 4 means there is no site at that path. The JSON gives you `diffClass`, `routes`, `lanes`,
`blocking` and `scope`. Print one line before you run a thing:

```
content change, 2 routes (narrow): /blog, /blog/welcome
lanes: caps schema voice functional a11y perf drift
```

If a content edit plans a wide scope, say so. That is a structural change wearing a content
change's clothes and the person should see it before they wait.

## 3. Run the lanes, cheapest first

Stop early only on a `cap`. Everything else runs so the report is complete in one pass.

**caps and schema (instant).**

```bash
node "$PALATE/scripts/palate-index.mjs" "$SITE"
cd "$SITE" && npx astro sync
```

A new entry in `links.dead`, or a route that disappeared from the index, is a `cap`. An
`astro sync` failure is a `cap`: the content collection schema in `src/content.config.ts`
rejected the frontmatter, so the site will not build.

**voice and tokens (seconds).**

```bash
bash "$PALATE/scripts/ux-lint.sh" "$SITE"
```

Exit 1 is a finding at High or above. On a structural change also run:

```bash
node "$PALATE/scripts/gate-scoped-style-escape.mjs" "$SITE"
node "$PALATE/scripts/phantom-utility-check.mjs" "$SITE"
```

**functional, a11y, perf and geometry (tens of seconds, one render pass).**

```bash
bash "$PALATE/scripts/serve-preview.sh" "$SITE"        # prints SERVE_URL=...
bash "$PALATE/scripts/verify-rendered.sh" "$SERVE_URL" --routes <affected routes> --out .palate-shots
```

Pass only the routes the plan named. One run covers four lanes: route reachability, axe at
three viewports, tap targets and contrast, per-section overflow, and Core Web Vitals under
PageSpeed's slow-4G and 4x CPU lab conditions. Exit 3 means no browser could be launched, and
that is a `block`, never a pass.

**drift (non-blocking).** Do not run it here. Say `run /palate-website-builder:drift for the appearance move`.

**taste (non-blocking).** Not run locally by this command. It is the paid half and it is what
`/palate-website-builder:grade` answers.

## 4. Heal before showing anything

Fix what is mechanically fixable yourself and re-run only the lane that failed. A missing alt
attribute, a tap target under 24px, a banned face, an em dash, a phantom utility class: fix
them, do not report them.

Bounded, and the bound is not negotiable:

- A move of **1 point or less** on the hygiene score is **unchanged**, not improvement. That is
  `NOISE_BAND` in `hygiene-loop.mjs`, and it is the figure the tool itself applies: on a +2 move
  it prints `improved`, so calling 2 unchanged would have this command contradicting the number
  it is reading. (The 2.3-point figure is the CERTIFIED grade's run-to-run spread, a different
  instrument on different infrastructure. Do not carry it over.)
- Two iterations with no material gain is a **stall**. Report it, name the checks that have not
  moved, and stop. A stall still blocks. "It stopped improving" is not "it is good enough".

## 5. Grounding, once

```bash
bash "$PALATE/scripts/gate-mcp-depth.sh" "$SITE/build-manifest.json"
```

Exit 3 is UNGROUNDED. It is a label, not a block, and it is orthogonal to the verdict: an
ungrounded merge is a real state. Say it once and never repeat it:

> The Palate MCP was not used for this change, so it carries no taste layer.
> `claude mcp add --scope user --transport http palate https://mcp.palatemcp.com/api/mcp`

## 6. Report

Fold the findings the way the contract folds them: a cap outranks everything, then block, then
heal, then review, else merge. One line per finding, and every line carries the lane, the
route, the number against its threshold, and the smallest fix:

```
VERDICT: review (grounded)

review  a11y   /blog/welcome   contrast 4.1:1 on .post-meta, floor 4.5:1
                               darken --ink-muted one step; it clears at #6D6B65
healed  voice  /blog           em dash in the excerpt -> comma
merged  perf   /blog           LCP 1,740ms under slow-4G, budget 2,500ms
```

Then append one line to `.palate/ledger.jsonl` (measured state, commit it) so `/palate-website-builder:report`
can say what was caught rather than only what shipped:

```json
{"at":"<iso>","verdict":"review","grounding":"grounded","class":"content","routes":["/blog"],"caught":[{"lane":"a11y","route":"/blog/welcome","what":"contrast 4.1:1"}],"healed":["voice/em-dash"]}
```

Never print a taste percentile here. This command did not compute one.
