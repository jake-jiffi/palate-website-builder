/**
 * hooks/palate-pretooluse.mjs - the build-site write gate (PreToolUse).
 *
 * Registered at the user level, matched on `Write|MultiEdit`. It does TWO things:
 *
 *  1. The DIVERGE WALL (default-ON, but scoped to an active build site). A Palate
 *     BUILD SITE must begin by diverging into 8-10 genuinely different directions
 *     BEFORE any site source is written. This hook ENFORCES that: when an active
 *     build-site marker (`.palate-skill-state.json`, written ONLY by the BUILD SITE
 *     flow's scripts/state-init.sh, before scaffold) is present and the build has not
 *     recorded a VALID diverge+converge in build-manifest.json, it BLOCKS the first
 *     NEW page/section source Write. No env var enables it; it is on whenever a build
 *     site is active. It NEVER traps a non-build: no marker => not a build => allow.
 *     The validity bar is MODE-AWARE: the marker's `brandMode` (brand-creation when no
 *     brand was provided, brand-provided when a brand package / real tokens / stated
 *     colours+fonts exist) sets WHICH axes the 8-10 must diverge on. brand-creation
 *     requires colour AND type to vary (the FULL identity space, since you are creating
 *     the brand); brand-provided LOCKS colour + type and judges distinctness on the
 *     within-brand axes (layout / composition / motion / density / art-direction).
 *
 *  2. The DEPTH NUDGE (unchanged, opt-in). When NO build-site marker is present the
 *     hook falls through to the original behaviour: NON-BLOCKING by default (the depth
 *     nudge is delivered by the skill and the Stop hook), HARD-BLOCK only under
 *     PALATE_GATE_STRICT=1, and even then fail-OPEN when the gate cannot be satisfied.
 *
 * Escape hatches (so it can never trap an ordinary edit or a non-build session):
 *   - PALATE_GATE_OFF=1 disables everything.
 *   - No `.palate-skill-state.json` marker => not a build site => allow (the primary
 *     scope wall: editing an existing app, a BUILD BRAND session, a small edit, or any
 *     non-Palate work never sees the wall).
 *   - Edit is never matched (only Write/MultiEdit), so editing an existing file is
 *     structurally exempt; a Write OVER an already-scaffolded NON page/section file
 *     (config, layout chrome, lib) is iteration and also allowed.
 *   - DIVERGE is a reasoning step, NOT an MCP call, so the wall does NOT depend on MCP
 *     liveness: the model writes manifest.diverge whether or not the MCP is connected.
 *     A tooling failure (fs throw) falls through to the depth path (allow under
 *     non-strict), so a failure can never wedge a write.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY DEPTH-ONLY for "done": this hook does NOT run the "done" gate
 * (gate-done.sh). The done gate judges a RENDER (screenshots + a built preview), and
 * at write-time nothing is rendered yet - so a done check here would trap every
 * mid-build source write. "Done" enforcement belongs at Stop (hooks/palate-stop.mjs).

// ANTI-GAMING: it is not enough to set ran:true. The set must have >= MIN_DIVERGE
