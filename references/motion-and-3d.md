# Motion and 3D - the recipe layer

The recipe layer the build reaches for when a concept earns motion, scroll
choreography or 3D. It exists so the skill can reach the 2026 ceiling even where the
reference library is thin on a frontier mechanic (the buildability oracle in
`reference-library-usage.md` falls back to these recipes when a donor query fails
closed). Each recipe has a fixed shape: **when to use it, the minimal working
implementation, a performance budget, and a `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback.**

Stack (all already in the template, except the opt-in Tier-2 packages): Astro 6 +
the Vercel adapter, `@astrojs/react`, `gsap` + `ScrollTrigger` + `@gsap/react`,
`lenis`. Tier 2 (`three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`) is **opt-in per
build, not a default dependency** - see the budget below.

## The one law: the LCP is never a canvas

The hydration ladder is non-negotiable. **The LCP element is always static text or a
static image, never a `<canvas>` or a Lottie.** Every Tier-1 / Tier-2 effect is
`client:visible` / `client:idle` so its bundle never touches first paint, and every
ceiling effect ships a static poster that is simultaneously the LCP, the no-JS state
and the reduced-motion state.

Example files referenced below live in `templates/astro-project/src/`:
`lib/motion.ts` (the Tier-0 / Tier-1 entry), `components/Motion.astro` (the wrapper),
`components/ThreeScene.tsx` (the opt-in Tier-2 R3F island example).

---

## Tier 0 - always ship (zero-JS, in every template, no island)

The default motion floor. Compositor-thread, 0 KB of framework JS, and degrades to
the finished state with no animation.

### Recipe 5 - CSS scroll-driven animation
- **When:** all reveals, parallax, progress bars. The default for entrance motion;
  it replaces a JS IntersectionObserver reveal.
- **Implementation:** `animation-timeline: view()` (or `scroll()`), `@supports`-gated,
  with `animation-fill-mode: both` so the no-animation state is the *finished* state
  (never an element stuck at `opacity:0`).
  ```css
  @supports (animation-timeline: view()) {
    [data-animate] {
      animation: reveal linear both;
      animation-timeline: view();
      animation-range: entry 0% cover 30%;
    }
    @keyframes reveal { from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(1.5rem); } to { opacity: 1; transform: none; } }
  }
  ```
- **Budget:** 0 KB JS, runs on the compositor thread. Animate only `opacity` and
  `transform`.
- **Reduced motion:** the global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` switch in
  `globals.css` neutralises it; `fill-mode: both` already leaves the element in its
  finished state.

### Recipe 6 - View Transitions
- **When:** SPA-feel page-to-page on the MPA, shared-element morphs (a gallery
  thumbnail growing into the detail hero). Highest leverage-per-effort move on Astro.
- **Implementation:** `<ClientRouter />` (already in `BaseLayout.astro`) plus
  `transition:name="..."` on the shared element on both pages.
- **Budget:** near-zero; Astro handles it. Cross-document VT support is ~92%.
- **Reduced motion:** Astro disables transitions automatically under reduced motion.

### Recipe 7 - kinetic / variable-font typography
- **When:** a scroll-mapped or hover-driven display headline. The 2026 "variable axis
  on scroll" hero at near-zero cost. Fraunces (`wght` / `opsz` / `SOFT`) is already
  self-hosted in the brand package.
- **Implementation:** animate `font-variation-settings` (or a CSS custom property the
  font reads), driven by Recipe 5's `animation-timeline: view()` or a CSS transition
  on hover. Never animate `font-weight` directly.
- **Budget:** 0 KB JS.
- **Reduced motion:** the global CSS switch neutralises the animation; the static
  weight is the resting state.

---

## Tier 1 - opt-in singletons / per-section islands

Reach for these when a section earns real motion. Section-scoped, lazy-hydrated,
each with its own JS reduced-motion guard (the global CSS switch alone cannot stop a
GSAP timeline or a Lenis RAF loop).

### Recipe 4 - Lenis smooth scroll (the one mandatory singleton)
- **When:** smooth scroll under any scroll-choreography. Mount ONCE.
- **Implementation:** `SmoothScroll` mounted once in `BaseLayout` via `Motion.astro`
  (`client:idle`, `transition:persist`). `autoRaf:false`; drive `lenis.raf` from
  `gsap.ticker` so there is ONE RAF; `lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update)`;
  `gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0)`; `destroy()` on cleanup; on `astro:after-swap` ->
  `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` + reset scroll. This is what `lib/motion.ts` wires.
- **Budget:** one RAF loop only. Never add a second manual `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Reduced motion:** `lib/motion.ts` early-returns on
  `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches` and never boots Lenis;
  native scroll remains.

### Recipe 3 - GSAP ScrollTrigger pin / scrub
- **When:** pin a section and scrub a sequence (a product story, a stepped reveal).
- **Implementation:** a `client:visible` island built with `useGSAP({ scope })` for
  auto-cleanup, wrapped in
  `gsap.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)')` so the timeline is
  simply never created under reduced motion. Animate transforms only;
  `invalidateOnRefresh:true`.
- **Budget:** ~50 KB, section-scoped, `client:visible`.
- **Reduced motion:** the `matchMedia` wrapper means no timeline is created; the
  section renders static.

### Recipe 8 - Lottie
- **When:** a below-the-fold vector animation (an illustrated step, a looping mark).
  Never above the fold, never the LCP.
- **Implementation:** a `client:visible` island that `import('lottie-web')`
  dynamically, gated on an IntersectionObserver, with a static poster fallback and
  `anim.destroy()` on unmount.
- **Budget:** dynamic import, below-the-fold only.
- **Reduced motion:** render the static poster, do not load `lottie-web`.

---

## Tier 2 - the optional R3F island (the ceiling, gated behind a perf budget)

The ceiling. Shipped as an **optional** module the build enables ONLY when a 3D /
shader moment earns its weight. One canvas per page, never the LCP. `three`,
`@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` are **not** in the default template
dependencies; the build installs them only for the variant that needs 3D (see the
budget). The example island is `components/ThreeScene.tsx`.

### Recipe 1 - R3F 3D island (glTF / interactive 3D product)
- **When:** a real 3D product moment (drag-to-orbit, explode-view, scroll-pinned
  product). For premium hardware / DTC / automotive briefs.
- **Implementation:** an Astro island hydrated `client:visible` (or
  `client:only="react"` if `three` trips SSR). `frameloop="demand"` (`"never"` under
  reduced motion), `dpr={[1,2]}`, Draco-compressed glTF, triangles < 150k, textures
  <= 2048px KTX2, a reserved aspect-ratio box, and a `<noscript>` / poster image.
- **Budget:** ~120-180 KB lazy bundle, never on first paint. One canvas per page.
- **Reduced motion:** the island renders its static poster image and never mounts the
  canvas (see `ThreeScene.tsx`).

### Recipe 2 - GLSL shader hero (the lowest-cost ceiling effect)
- **When:** a flagship shader surface (fluid-distortion, gradient-mesh, noise,
  refraction-on-hover). The 2026 hero ceiling.
- **Implementation:** a `client:visible` island using drei `shaderMaterial`, a
  fullscreen clip-space quad, `precision mediump`, `antialias:false`, and `dt`-based
  uniform mutation inside `useFrame` (NEVER React state per frame). The WebP poster is
  the LCP and the no-JS state; `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { canvas { display:none } }`.
- **Budget:** lowest-cost ceiling effect; still one canvas, `dpr` capped at 2,
  `client:visible`.
- **Reduced motion:** the poster shows, the canvas is hidden, `useFrame` never runs.

---

## The performance + prefers-reduced-motion budget

Ship and enforce this so ambition stays ~60fps and accessible. The full budget also
lives as `templates/astro-project/MOTION_BUDGET.md` next to the recipe files.

- **LCP is always static.** Tier-1 / Tier-2 islands are `client:visible` /
  `client:idle` so their bundles never touch first paint. Target a fast LCP from
  static text / image, never a canvas.
- **Reduced motion is layered, not one switch.** The global CSS
  `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` switch in `globals.css` neutralises CSS
  animation ONLY - it cannot stop a GSAP timeline, a Lenis RAF loop or a three.js
  draw loop. So EVERY Tier-1 / Tier-2 recipe also needs its own JS guard
  (`matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches` early-return, or
  `gsap.matchMedia`), plus the `@supports` gate for CSS scroll-driven animation, plus
  a static poster for every ceiling effect. Every ceiling effect MUST have a static
  fallback.
- **One WebGL canvas per page.** Never a full-page-height WebGL canvas as a permanent
  background. `dpr` capped at 2. `frameloop="demand"` (pause when off-screen). Mind
  the main-thread cost and mobile-GPU thermal limits; budget DPR / triangle count /
  visibility-pausing.
- **One RAF loop only.** Lenis runs on `gsap.ticker`; R3F runs its own demand loop.
  Never a second manual `requestAnimationFrame`.

### Keeping the default template lean (why Tier 2 is opt-in)
`three` + R3F + drei add ~120-180 KB to a bundle. If they sat in the template's
default `package.json`, every generated site would ship (or at least install) a WebGL
toolchain it does not use, which violates the lean-default invariant. So:
- the default template depends only on `gsap` + `lenis` (Tier 0/1, already present);
- `ThreeScene.tsx` ships as a commented / opt-in EXAMPLE, not a wired-in component;
- the build adds `three` / `@react-three/fiber` / `@react-three/drei` to the
  project's `package.json` ONLY for the variant that genuinely needs 3D, and mounts
  the island only on that page. A calm brief never pays for the 3D tier.

## Reach (document, do not pre-build)
- **WebGPU + TSL** (`three/webgpu`, automatic WebGL2 fallback) as the Recipe-1 / 2
  upgrade path now WebGPU is baseline (incl. Safari / iOS, Sept 2025).
- **GSAP SplitText** (now free) for character-stagger kinetic type.
- **Rive** for data-driven vector UI motion alongside GSAP.

## Note for CURATE (library / moat work, not implementable in the skill)
The reference library is deep on motion craft per ref but **narrow on the frontier**:
only ~21 of ~229 entries carry any WebGL and the live MCP fails closed on the three
highest-value frontier mechanics - **shader-surface hero**, **interactive 3D
product** and **cursor-driven physics** (the queries return real-but-wrong
fallbacks). Until a CURATE-side audit tags and sources award-grade motion / 3D donors
(`hasWebgl`, motion-intensity, a complete `astro_recipe`, plus the new `shader-surface`
/ `cursor-physics` / `model-viewer-3d` mechanics and `renderer` / `shaderFamily` /
`canvasLightness` facets), the buildability oracle will return thin or wrong
precedents for those mechanics and MUST fall back to the recipes here. The
demand-ranked donor work-list is recorded in
`docs/ambition-tier-requirements-2026-06-18.md` (Part 1) and belongs to the private
`palate-library` repo. This is the one genuine external dependency of Move 4; the
recipe layer is the floor that keeps the build unblocked until it lands.
