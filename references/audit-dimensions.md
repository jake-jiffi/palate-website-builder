# Audit dimensions - the pre-production reviewer pass

After Compose, before the production checkpoint, Claude takes a deliberate
reviewer stance and walks the canonical pages against this 11-dimension audit.
The output is a findings list in the format described at the bottom of this
file. Critical and High findings block the build; the verify-fail loop in
`errors.md` applies.

This pass is interpretive (the structural counterpart is
`verify-is-real-astro.sh`; the aesthetic-mechanical counterpart is
`scripts/ux-lint.sh`). A senior reviewer's eye, codified.

## The dimensions

### 1. Visual hierarchy

Is the most important thing on the page also the most visually weighted? Is
there exactly one Z1 element per screen, or are several fighting? A typical
failure: the hero, the nav CTA and a feature card all use the brand accent at
the same weight.

### 2. Spacing rhythm

Is vertical spacing on a documented scale (8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 80),
or has it been freelanced per section? Are section padding choices consistent
within a page (e.g. all `py-20` or all `py-24`, not a mix)? Compare against the
donor's documented scale from `refs_get { slug, layer:"tokens" }` (or
`format:"design"`), not just internal consistency.

### 3. Typography pairing

Is there a clear display / body distinction at scale, weight, or family?
Are there fewer than three font sizes per section? Is line-length between
50 and 80 characters for body text? Compare against the donor's documented
type scale from `refs_get { slug, layer:"tokens" }` (or `format:"design"`), not
just internal consistency.

### 4. Empty states

Does every list / collection / search result have a designed empty state?
Does the blog index render gracefully when zero items have been published?
Forms with no submissions yet, dashboards with nothing to show, search with
no matches - all named, all designed.

### 5. Loading states

Every async region (CMS-fetched content, OG image generation, form submit)
has a designed loading state. No bare spinners; named skeletons or
explicit progress.

### 6. Error states

Forms render their error states deliberately (per-field message, accessible
to a screen reader, not red-on-red); fetch failures degrade to the `content.ts`
fallback rather than a blank section; 404 and 500 routes exist and feel like
they belong to the site, not generic Astro defaults. Validation fires on blur
for a filled field and on submit for an empty required one, never mid-typing;
the form has explicit submitting, success and failure states with visible,
announced feedback.

### 7. Dark mode (only if the brand supports it)

If the brand has a documented dark mode, every page passes a dark-mode pass:
contrast on text holds, brand accents do not glow, images that were tuned
for a light background still read.

### 8. Density and breathing room

The page does not feel either claustrophobic (every gap collapsed to 8px) or
unfocused (every gap blown out to 96px). Density matches the audience: dense
for power users, breathing room for narrative / consumer pages.

### 9. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA minimum)

Visible focus on every interactive element. Colour contrast >= 4.5:1 for body,
>= 3:1 for large text. Forms have labels and `aria-describedby` for errors;
each label sits above its field (a placeholder is never the only label), and
inputs carry the right `type` / `inputmode` / `autocomplete`.
No motion that violates `prefers-reduced-motion`. Headings descend in order
without skipping levels.

### 10. Copy quality

Body copy is specific (passes the Conceptual Grounding Test from
`critique-discipline.md`); CTAs use a verb + noun shape ("See pricing" not
"Learn more"); the page would not be improved by deleting another 30% of the
words.

### 11. Reference fidelity / bespoke-ness

Does the page reproduce the lead reference's signature compositional move(s),
named and located? Point to it ("the donor's full-bleed pinned hero stage, at
`index.astro` L12-40, re-skinned to the brand"). Is the type / motion / grid the
reference's actual system (its scale, easings, rhythm re-skinned) or a Tailwind
default standing in for it? This is the positive counterpart to the anti-default
detector in `critique-discipline.md`: the audit fails not just for being slop,
but for being generic where a reference should have been reproduced.

Before the pass, re-pull the lead donor's tokens: `refs_get { slug, layer:"tokens" }`
(or `format:"design"` for the DESIGN.md with the rationale) plus
`refs_get_screenshot`, and compare the built page's type scale, easings and spacing
rhythm against the donor's documented numbers, not your memory of them. Auditing
from memory is itself a finding: if the pass did not re-pull the donor, say so.

Check against structured data, not memory: the donor's `sections[]` name the move
per section (`signatureMove`); read the move via `refs_get { slug,
layer:"signature_moves" }` and the rules via `refs_get { slug, layer:"do_dont" }`.
`format:"design"` returns a DESIGN.md the reviewer can diff the built page against.
Name the move, locate it in the code, and confirm the page does not break the
donor's `do_dont`.

A page that is **default-shaped with no reproduced signature move** is a Critical
finding (it is the exact failure this skill exists to beat). A page that uses
Tailwind-default type / spacing / motion where the lead reference had a distinct
system is High. Identity-layer borrowing (exact hexes, wordmark, font files,
photos, a trademark-grade gimmick) is also a finding - the fidelity is to the
craft layer, never the trade dress (see the two-layer doctrine in
`reference-library-usage.md`).

### 12. Landing conversion (landing / single-action routes only)

On a landing page or any single-action route, the conversion craft is its own
dimension. One primary action, repeated down a long page rather than hunted for;
the global site nav dropped (use `LandingLayout`, which omits the header slot,
not `BaseLayout`); a social-proof unit next to the primary CTA, not only in the
footer, and specific rather than vague (name three, not "trusted by 1000+"); the
lead form kept to one or two fields. A landing page that carries the full nav,
buries its one action, or asks for more fields than it needs is a High finding.
This applies only to landing / conversion routes; content pages keep their nav.

## Output format (for the reviewer pass)

Follow the Vercel review format, copied in. No preamble. No padding. No
encouraging sentences. Findings grouped by file, in this shape:

```
src/pages/index.astro
  L23 [Critical / hierarchy] Hero CTA and nav CTA both use --brand-accent at
       100%; the hero loses primacy. Suggest desaturating nav to --brand-muted.
  L78 [High / empty-state] Features grid renders nothing when content array
       is empty; add a one-line note and a sample card.
  pass

src/pages/blog/index.astro
  L14 [High / empty-state] Blog index has no zero-items state; add a copy
       block "First post coming soon" and a subscribe link.
  L42 [Medium / typography] Three font sizes in one card (24, 18, 14).
       Drop the 18; promote 14 if it carries metadata.
```

`pass` is allowed on a file with no Critical or High findings, but skipping
files because they "look fine" is a regression. Walk every page on the audit
route.

Severity mapping: Critical halts the build; High halts by default
(`--fail-on=High` is the default for the reviewer pass); Medium reports;
Cosmetic is advice.

After fixes, re-run the reviewer pass and re-run `scripts/ux-lint.sh`. Both
must come back clean before the production checkpoint.
