# The SELF-HEAL LOOP around the BUILD HYGIENE score, driven end to end against a real browser
# and a real page.
#
# hygiene-loop.test.mjs covers the arithmetic. This covers the thing that actually has to work:
# a deliberately generic page is served, the gate blocks it, the message tells an agent what
# to fix and what to re-run, the page is then repaired IN PLACE at the same URL, and the next
# run has to report the gain. Five states, in the order a real build hits them:
#
#   1. FIRST     - blocked, ranked gaps, the exact re-run command, no invented baseline
#   2. UNCHANGED - the same page re-measured must NOT read as progress
#   3. STALLED   - a third flat run stops the loop and names what is frozen
#   4. IMPROVING - the repaired page reports the gain, and the denominator caveat with it
#   5. REGRESSED - putting the fault back reports a regression and says to revert
#
# Plus the two silent-skip paths (a corrupt history, no --out), which must SPEAK, and the
# hand-off to hooks/palate-stop.mjs, which must surface the grade message even when it is
# buried behind other failures.
