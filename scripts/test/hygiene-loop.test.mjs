/**
 * hygiene-loop.mjs - the self-heal arithmetic, which is pure and needs no browser.
 *
 * The assertions that matter are the ones about what this loop REFUSES to call progress.
 * Run-to-run spread on an unchanged page is 2.3 points (measured over five consecutive
 * grades: 76, 78, 80, 81, 76), so a +2 move must read as UNCHANGED. If it ever reads as
 * IMPROVING, the loop starts teaching an agent that its last random edit worked, and every
 * iteration after that is chasing noise. The boundary is tested from both sides.
 *
 * The live end-to-end (does it actually block, does the message actually say the right
 * thing) is scripts/test/hygiene-loop.test.sh, which drives a real browser over a real page.
