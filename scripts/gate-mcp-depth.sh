# anywhere (CI, pre-commit, Cursor) on its own.

# Exit 0 = pass, 2 = block (with a specific, actionable reason on stderr).
#
# Thresholds are overridable via env. These DEFAULTS are the gentle public-plugin
# bar (enough to guarantee a build actually drew on the library, without blocking a
# quick site). Raise PALATE_MIN_REFS / PALATE_MIN_INNER for a stricter bar;
# PALATE_GATE_OFF=1 disables the gate entirely.
# Overridable: PALATE_MIN_REFS, PALATE_MIN_INNER, PALATE_MIN_TOOLS, PALATE_MIN_RICH_LAYER.
