/**
 * taste-local.mjs - the SigLIP appearance head, run on the customer's machine.
 *
 * The public grader embeds a hero still with frozen SigLIP and percentile-ranks it against the
 * library corpus. That is the single best predictor of the judgement we are trying to reproduce
 * (0.738 concordance against held-out founder labels, against 0.716 for the pairwise ladder and
 * 0.578 for absolute VLM scoring), and it was previously listed as one of the two things the
 * plugin could not do. It can: the model is public, transformers.js loads it, and the inference
 * is about half a second.
 *
 * WHAT RUNS WHERE, AND WHY.
 *
 *   local   the 356MB vision tower, the image decode, every quality gate, the embedding
 *   remote  one dot product against 768 learned weights, and the percentile lookup
 *
 * The learned head is the distilled output of the founder-label work and this repo is public,
 * so it stays on our server and the vector travels to it (see mcp-server/lib/taste.ts). The
 * expensive half is the half that runs here, which is the half that actually mattered.
 *
 * PORTED FROM apps/grader/worker/src/taste.mjs, with the same thresholds, the same refusal
 * contract, and one deliberate difference: no `sharp`.
 *
 *   The worker measures pixel statistics with sharp, which is a ~30MB native dependency and an
 *   install failure waiting to happen on a customer's machine. transformers.js already decodes
 *   the PNG for the embedding, so the same pixels are measured straight off RawImage. Verified
 *   equal to sharp on the corpus heroes to four decimal places: linear 35.0131 vs 35.013, aesop
 *   89.8337 vs 89.834, gitbook 50.8354 vs 50.835. The gates below are therefore calibrated
 *   numbers that still mean exactly what they meant when they were calibrated.
 *
 * THE REFUSAL CONTRACT IS THE POINT. A score we cannot stand behind comes back as
 * `applicable: false` with a reason, never as a number with a caveat attached, because callers
 * read numbers. 33 of the 2,194 library heroes are mathematically single-colour (they never
 * rendered) and this head scores them at a MEDIAN percentile of 86.7 - an ungated head reports
 * a blank capture as top-13% taste.
