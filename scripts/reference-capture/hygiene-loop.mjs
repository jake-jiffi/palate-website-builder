/**
 * hygiene-loop.mjs - the SELF-HEAL loop around the BUILD HYGIENE score.
 *
 * WHAT THIS NUMBER IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It rolls up the checks measurable WITHOUT a model and
 * WITHOUT a judge: framework-default accents, default-only type stacks, WCAG 2.5.8 tap targets,
 * sub-16px mobile body, axe violations, Core Web Vitals. That is HYGIENE, and that boundary is
 * the point - it runs in seconds on every build, needing nothing downloaded and nobody's opinion.
 * It is NOT a prediction of the public grade, and this file used to call it one.
 *
 * The measurement that killed that name: across 23 fresh re-grades, the local number correlated
 * with the public grade at r = -0.074 like for like (16 domains in both), mean absolute gap 18.0
 * points, regression grader = 40.0 + 0.323 x local, residual sd 18.2. No predictive power.
 *
 * THE REFERENCE WAS BROKEN WHILE THAT WAS TAKEN. capture.mjs computed `out.design` per viewport
 * and then dropped it at the `viewportsOut` whitelist, so the worker read undefined and checks.mjs
 * sailed past its truthy guard: production grades stamped `2026-08-06.design-measured` were
 * scoring design on 4 of 11 checks. The five missing - type_system_discipline,
 * colour_accent_discipline, spacing_rhythm, component_detail_craft, responsive_integrity - are
 * EXACTLY the checks this score is built from.
 *
 * THAT BUG MAKES THE CAUSAL TEST CLEANER, NOT MURKIER, WHICH I HAD BACKWARDS. With those five
 * dropped, the certified design dimension is currently the VISION HALF ALONE (appearance head plus
 * pairwise ladder). So there are two local numbers measured against the same vision-only
 * reference: this one, carrying no vision, at r = -0.074 over 23; and local-grade's tier 2, which
 * adds a locally-run SigLIP head and ladder, at r = +0.83 / rho = +0.86, mean absolute gap 10.0,
 * over 7. The vision half is what tracks the grade. A number without it cannot, and that is this
 * one's permanent condition by construction.
 *
 * The sharpest version of that: on the same seven, the taste percentile ALONE tracks the certified
 * grade at r = 0.90, better than tier 2's whole composite at 0.83. The appearance head out-predicts
 * the thing it is a component of. So it is not "vision plus hygiene beats hygiene" - it is vision,
 * and mixing hygiene into it currently dilutes the signal.
 *
 * So my own retraction over-corrected. "The grade is mostly design" is now the better-supported
 * explanation rather than an unproven one. What HAS gone stale is the other half of the sentence:
 * design can no longer be called unrunnable locally, because local-grade runs both the head and
 * the ladder on the customer's machine.
 *
 * HOLD ALL OF IT LOOSELY UNTIL THE DEPLOY. n = 7 puts the 95% CI on r = +0.83 at roughly
 * [0.21, 0.97] - directionally strong, numerically vague. Both figures are pre-deploy, and once
 * the capture fix reaches Fly the certified design dimension gets those five computed checks back,
 * which should RAISE this number's correlation (it would share inputs with the reference again)
 * and may lower tier 2's. That is a prediction, recorded here so the re-measure can falsify it.
 * Re-run projected-vs-graded.mjs after the deploy.
 *
 * None of that rescues the old name. Whatever the cause, this number did not predict the number
 * customers were given, and calling it a "projected grade" told an agent, and through it a
 * customer, that clearing 80 here predicts scoring 80 publicly. The real number comes from
 * `mcp__palate__palate_grade { url }` at done time, and that is the only one that may be shared.
 *
 * The gate and the loop are unchanged and still worth having. These are real faults and fixing
 * them is real work. Only the CLAIM was wrong.
 *
 * verify-rendered.mjs already computes the score and blocks below the floor, naming the gaps.
 * That is a gate, not a loop. Blocking tells an agent it failed; it does not tell it whether
 * the thing it just changed helped, and an agent that cannot see whether it is converging will
 * thrash: it will keep editing, keep re-running, and have no way to tell a real gain from the
 * noise floor.
 *
 * This module closes it. It persists each projection beside the build and turns the next run
 * into a comparison: up, down, or unchanged, with the gaps that moved and the ones that did
 * not. Four properties are load-bearing.
 *
 *   1. NOISE IS NOT PROGRESS. Five consecutive grades of an unchanged page returned
 *      76, 78, 80, 81, 76 - one sd of 2.3 points. So a move of +/-2 reads as UNCHANGED and
 *      never as improvement. A loop that celebrates noise teaches the agent that its last
 *      random edit worked, which is worse than no signal at all.
 *
 *   2. A COMPARISON MUST BE LIKE FOR LIKE. `--no-vitals` drops 14 of the 100 weight, and
 *      an unmeasurable dimension drops out of the denominator entirely, so two runs can
 *      report different numbers for an identical page. Every entry records the exact set of
 *      check ids it scored; a run against a different set reports NO COMPARISON and says why,
 *      rather than printing a delta that means nothing.
 *
 *   3. THE LOOP IS BOUNDED. Two iterations with no material gain is a stall, and a stall is
 *      reported as one: it names the checks that have not moved and tells the agent to stop
 *      and escalate rather than run a fourth pass. It does NOT release the gate - a stalled
 *      build still blocks - because "it stopped improving" is not the same fact as "it is
 *      good enough", and only a human gets to decide the second.
 *
 *   4. IT FAILS LOUD. An unreadable or unwritable history, or a run with no --out to persist
 *      to, is SAID rather than swallowed. Every silent skip in this product's history
 *      reported a clean result while measuring nothing.
 *
 * The history is bookkeeping, so nothing here is ever fatal to a build: the caller reports
 * the problem and carries on with the gate it already had.

 * (15) are 45 of the design dimension's 100, and both are judgements no local computation can
 * make, so the projection scores design over 32 points of denominator and is structurally blind

 * therefore never binds here. Measured on this repo's own tidy-template fixture - three
 * identical bordered card grids, stock marketing copy, no idea in it anywhere - build hygiene
 * scores 97/100 with a design dimension of 97 on 3 of 11 checks. That number is the honest
 * summary of what this instrument is, so it is quoted rather than paraphrased.
 *
 * THE SECOND HALF IS WORSE AND LESS OBVIOUS: A CLEAN PAGE RESTS ON LESS EVIDENCE, NOT MORE.
 * The axe checks only enter the roll-up when they FIRE, so repairing them removes the entire
 * accessibility dimension from the denominator. Measured across the same two fixtures under
 * --no-vitals, the generic page scored 21 on 52 weight (design + accessibility) and the repaired
 * one scored 97 on 40 (design alone, 3 of its 11 checks). With vitals on it is 66 -> 54, the same
 * 12-point drop. So the basis THINS exactly as the score rises, which is the worst possible
 * pairing: the number is at its most flattering and least supported at the moment an agent is
 * most likely to stop. Hence the live `measuredWeight` in the message rather than a fixed claim.
