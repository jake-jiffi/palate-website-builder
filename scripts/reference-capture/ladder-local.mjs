/**
 * ladder-local.mjs - the pairwise design ladder, judged by the agent that did the build.
 *
 * The public grader runs this ladder with paid vision calls on a Fly machine. The plugin cannot
 * call an API for it and does not need to: the agent running the build IS a vision model, and it
 * is already sitting in the loop. So this module does not judge. It STATES the comparison, then
 * scores what comes back, using the worker's arithmetic unchanged.
 *
 * Everything the worker's ladder.mjs learned the hard way is preserved here, because each rule
 * exists to fix a measured failure:
 *
 *   1. THREE COMPARISONS, ALWAYS. The pack once carried two per vertical and the ladder silently
 *      ran on two. Design craft is 40% of the grade and the ladder owns 45 of its 100 points, so
 *      a third less evidence measurably widened the spread: jiffi.co moved 40 points across three
 *      runs of an unchanged site.
 *
 *   2. EVERY COMPARISON JUDGED TWICE WITH THE POSITIONS SWAPPED, and on disagreement the LOWER
 *      rung wins. Position bias is the best-documented failure of pairwise VLM judging and
 *      swapping is the only control that detects it. An unstable verdict is not evidence of
 *      quality.
 *
 *   3. SCORE FROM THE MEAN, NOT THE MEDIAN RUNG. With n=3 and rung values 0.15/0.4/0.7/0.9 the
 *      median either does not move or moves a whole rung, which is 3.6 points of the final grade
 *      decided by two judges out of three landing on the other side of a near-tie. The mean
 *      bounds one judge's influence to a third of a rung. The reported rung is then the one
 *      NEAREST the mean, so the label a person reads and the number they are scored on cannot
 *      disagree.
 *
 *   4. THE SIGNATURE MOVE IS A FRACTION, NOT A VOTE. As a boolean it was a 4.2-point step in the
 *      final grade turning on one judge changing its mind about a borderline page - the largest
 *      single source of run-to-run movement in the rubric. The endpoints are unchanged: nobody
 *      saw one -> 0.15, everybody did -> 0.85.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THAT IS GENUINELY HARDER LOCALLY: independence. The worker fires its two swapped
 * comparisons as separate API calls, so neither can see the other's answer. An agent judging both
 * orderings in one context is not running the control, it is asking itself to agree with itself.
 * So the request tells the caller to dispatch each judgement to a FRESH subagent, and the
 * judgements file must declare whether that happened. A run that declares otherwise is scored,
 * and marked low-confidence with the reason stated. It is never silently accepted as if the
 * control had run.
