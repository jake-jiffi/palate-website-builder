/**
 * grade-local.mjs - a full Palate grade, computed on your own machine, for free.
 *
 * ================================ WHAT THIS IS ================================
 *
 * A SELF-CHECK. It is not a certified grade and must never be presented as one.
 *
 * It runs on your machine, from inputs you control, so it can be faked. That does not matter
 * for the job it exists to do - gaming yourself is pointless - and it matters entirely the
 * moment a number is shared. The two are different objects with different jobs:
 *
 *   THIS (free, local, unlimited)      fix your own site. Run it after every iteration.
 *   `palate_grade` (10 units, remote)  prove something to someone else. Run it once, at done.
 *
 * You do not need certification to fix your own site. You need it to show a client, put a
 * number in a proposal, or compare against anyone else's.
 *
 * ============================== WHY IT CAN EXIST ==============================
 *
 * A certified grade costs us about US$1.06: roughly $0.95 of Fly machine for ~100 seconds of
 * Chromium, plus ~$0.11 of vision calls. That price is why the real grader is a done-time
 * check and could never be an inner-loop one. But almost none of that cost has to be ours,
 * because this runs where the customer already has the expensive parts:
 *
 *   capture         a real browser, which this plugin already drives at both viewports
 *   appearance head SigLIP via transformers.js, ~540ms once the model is cached
 *   the judge       the agent reading this IS a vision model
 *   the rubric      rubric.mjs, vendored here and byte-identical to the grader's
 *
 * What is left for the server is a row read and a dot product, both free: `palate_grade_pack`
 * for the references and the judging prompt, `palate_taste_score` to project the embedding onto
 * the learned taste head (which stays on our server, because this repo is public).
 *
 * ================================== HOW IT RUNS ==================================
 *
 * Two phases, because the judge is the agent and the agent has to be handed the question.
 *
 *   1. node grade-local.mjs --url https://example.com [--vertical health]
 *        Captures the hero at 1440x900, measures the page, embeds it, fetches the pack,
 *        downloads the reference screenshots, and writes a judgement request naming six
 *        comparisons. Prints what to do next.
 *
 *   2. (the agent judges the six comparisons and writes the answers to a JSON file)
 *
 *   3. node grade-local.mjs --judgements <file>
 *        Scores with the grader's own rubric and prints the grade.
 *
 * FIRST RUN DOWNLOADS ~356MB (the SigLIP vision tower), once, and says so before it starts.
 *
 * ================================= FAIL LOUD =================================
 *
 * Every part that does not run is NAMED and dropped from the denominator, never scored around.
 * `measuredWeight` reports how much of the grader's 100 weight the number actually rests on, so
 * a grade computed without the ladder cannot be mistaken for one computed with it. This product
 * has a long history of silent skips reporting clean results while measuring nothing.

 * THE FLATTERY BAND: where this instrument is known to over-score, it does not
 * publish a point estimate.
 *
 * Measured over seven sites against fresh certified grades. Sorted by the appearance head's
 * percentile, the error is not noise, it is a step:
 *
 *   taste p22  hightownpharmacy   certified 41   local 58   +17
 *   taste p43  properly.sg        certified 36   local 62   +26
 *   ------------------------------------------------- p50 -------
 *   taste p57  linear.app         certified 60   local 56    -4
 *   taste p73  palatemcp.com      certified 83   local 75    -8
 *   taste p92  nocturne-label     certified 90   local 95    +5
 *   taste p94  jiffi.co           certified 73   local 67    -6
 *   taste p99  web-design-mcp     certified 87   local 91    +4
 *
 * Above the corpus median the gap is never worse than 8. Below it, both sites were flattered,
 * by 17 and 26.
 *
 * WHY THE GATE IS ON TASTE AND NOT ON THE SCORE. The obvious guard - withhold below some local
 * score - cannot work here, because the failure IS that the local score is too high: those two
 * sites came out 58 and 62, comfortably mid-table. The appearance head is the only signal
 * available at grade time that separates them, and it does so cleanly. It earns that job:
 * across these seven, r(taste, certified) = 0.90, HIGHER than r(local grade, certified) = 0.83.
 * The head already knew.
 *
 * WHY THE ARITHMETIC IS NOT SIMPLY CHANGED INSTEAD. The prior lifts above p85 and pulls below
 * p10. hightownpharmacy at p22 and properly.sg at p43 sit in the dead zone: correctly ranked in
 * the bottom half and forbidden from being corrected. Widening the pull threshold would move
 * exactly these two numbers and prove nothing, so the asymmetry is REPORTED rather than tuned.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN A CALIBRATION ISSUE. This is a self-check for someone deciding
 * whether their site needs rebuilding. Flattering a bad site is the one error that costs them
 * the decision: they read 62, conclude they are mid-pack, and do nothing. A certified 36 never
 * gets the chance to change their mind.
