# Phase B: provision Sanity. Creates project, dataset, TWO tokens (viewer for
# frontend reads, editor for the form handler writing to formSubmission),
# and CORS for the site origin. The Studio is EMBEDDED in the site via
# @sanity/astro (route /studio) - there is no separate Studio to deploy.
# Uses the Management API via curl (more reliable than sanity init --no-interactive).
# Requires: SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN (manage scope), SANITY_ORG_ID (your Sanity org id;
# JIFFI_SANITY_ORG_ID is accepted as a fallback for existing setups).
# Usage: provision-sanity.sh <slug> <display-name> <site-domain> [editors-csv]
